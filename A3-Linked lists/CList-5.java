 * What I thought about this assignment: This assignment was truly thought-provoking. It challenged our <br>
 * ability to learn about a data structure from simply reading about it, as we had to code an entire program <br>
 * without really ever having learned about linked lists before. The multi-faceted abilities of linked lists <br>
 * clearly make them an important and formidable data structure within the scope of the class and beyond.
